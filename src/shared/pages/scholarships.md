CascadiaJS exists to educate and grow the JavaScript community in the Pacific Northwest. We're constantly seeking new ways to make our community broader and more inclusive, so we're excited to work with our community to fund a Scholarship Program. Scholarship recipients will receive a heavily discounted ticket to the conference (\$100).

## Requirements

The Scholarship Program is open to everyone who meets these requirements:

- Able to attend both days of the conference (Nov 7 &amp; Nov 8)
- Resident of the Pacific Northwest
- Member of an under-represented minority (URM) in tech -or-
- Have financial constraints that would otherwise prevent you from attending

For folks who live more than a 1-hour drive from Seattle, we will help arrange travel and lodging.
