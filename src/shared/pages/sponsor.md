# Sponsor CascadiaJS 2019

The most important thing we do as a conference is bring developers together to meet, build relationships and learn from one another. Many of the attendees who come to CascadiaJS do so because they are trying to learn new skills, become better engineers, build their professional network or find a new job. For companies that are hiring or building products for developers, sponsoring CascadiaJS is a great way to connect with these folks.

If you'd like to support our event or have any questions, please email carter@cascadiajs.com.

<h2 id="venue"><i class="fas fa-university"></i> Venue</h2>

The highest level of visibility that we offer. Your company will be considered the
foundational partner in putting on CascadiaJS 2019. We would not be in a position to rent
out Town Hall Seattle without your support.

<h2 id="track"><i class="fas fa-users-class"></i> Day One / Day Two Tracks</h2>

Your company will be associated with the 12 awesome talks being given on either Day One
or Day Two of the conference. Your support makes it possible for us to fly in subject
matter experts from all over the world and take care of their lodging in Seattle during their
stay. 

<h2 id="party"><i class="fas fa-gamepad"></i> Opening / Closing Parties</h2>

Following each day of talks we put on a really fun social event for our attendees. Last year we rented out Cinerama and Living Computers and the feedback on those events was amazing. We only offer a single sponsorship for each event, so we'll work closely with your team to craft an amazing experience.

<h2 id="booth"><i class="fas fa-tshirt"></i> Booth</h2>

Set-up a booth to showcase your product to our attendees. We'll make sure you're set-up with
power and Wi-Fi and are located in high traffic areas as folks make their way around the
event.  

<h2 id="coffee"><i class="fas fa-coffee-togo"></i> Coffee</h2>

An upgraded form of our Booth sponsorship, except you are located next to the Espresso Cart!

<h2 id="mixer"><i class="fas fa-user-graduate"></i> Mentor Mixer</h2>

The evening before the conference we will organize a mixer that pairs our scholarship recipients with our amazing network of technical mentors. Last year this functioned as the culmination of our Scholarship Program where we connected our ~50 scholarship recipients to mentors who helped them understand how they could get the most out of the CascadiaJS experience. It was considered by many of our scholarship recipients and mentors to be the best part of the conference.

<h2 id="team"><i class="fas fa-handshake"></i> Meet the Team</h2>

This is perfect if you're bring your team to the event and have an open job that you're hiring for. Comes with a job posting, a block of 4 tickets, 20% any additional tickets and access to private meeting rooms where we will help you book time to meet any of our attendees who are interested in your position.

<h2 id="captions"><i class="fas fa-closed-captioning"></i> Captioning</h2>

We will be live captioning all 24 talks for the hearing impaired. Your logo will be included on the site we use to display the captioning as well as the videos that we produce and upload to YouTube. 

<h2 id="birds"><i class="fas fa-feather"></i> Birds of a Feather</h2>

We will be setting-up "interest areas" throughout the venue where folks who share an interest (ReactJS, GraphQL, etc) can congregate and meet one another. We are looking for companies who are heavily involved in technical space (i.e. NoSQL) to staff these areas,  facilitate introduction and moderate conversations. If your company's product or engineering team has deep expertise in a technical topic of interest to our attendees this is a great option you for. 

<h2 id="bus"><i class="fas fa-bus"></i> Hacker Bus</h2>

We are chartering buses to bring developers to Seattle down from Vancouver, BC and up from Portland, OR! Help folks travel to Seattle in style, make some new friends and enjoy submitting PR's on the Wi-Fi buses.

<h2 id="scholarships"><i class="fas fa-hand-holding-heart"></i> Scholarships</h2>

Help us fund 50 scholarships to CascadiaJS this year! Each Scholarship purchased comes with 1 complimentary ticket to the conference for the sponsor.
