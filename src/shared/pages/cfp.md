# Call for Presenters (closes June 30, 2019)

Thank you for your interest in speaking at our upcoming conference. This CFP is design for both new speakers (no conference experience) AND experienced speakers. Here are a few important notes before you continue:

* üé• You must have published your video submission in order to submit this form.
* ‚è≥ Talks are 25 minutes long with no Q&A following the talk.
* üìÜ CFP closes at 11:59 PM Pacific US time on June 30, 2019.
* üõ© We cover all travel expenses and arrange for lodging for out of town speakers.
* üòÖ You commit to work with us on the talk and practice it several times.
* üôå We'll support and mentor you in whatever way you need!

Please review the information below before you submit to the CFP.

## New Speakers

We are explicitly looking for new voices in our industry (i.e. anyone who hasn't given a big conference talk). Some of the best talks given at past CascadiaJS events have come from folks giving their first conference talk. Every developer has a story: about how they got into this industry, how their team solved a problem, how they used the open web to create an amazing experience. We hope that you‚Äôll tell us about yours! 

Meetups, smaller events, school talks don't count as "big conference talks", so please make sure to mark yourself as a "new speaker" when you apply!

## Representation

We are also looking for stories from folks who belong to underrepresented groups (URMs) in our industry. Seattle (and the Pacific Northwest) has a bad reputation for being pretty homogenous, and we want to create an environment for all kinds of speakers, from all kinds of backgrounds, because we beleive that makes a difference in shifting the inclusivity of our industry forward. 

## Code of Conduct

Please review our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cascadiajs/2018.cascadiajs.com/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md). Everyone who participates in our conference agrees to the enforcement of our CoC, and includes our friends, speakers, staff, sponsors, and attendees.

## Perks

If we accept your proposal to speak, the following items are taken care of by us:

* One ticket to the conference
* Lodging for 3 nights in Seattle
* Travel to/from Seattle
* A few surprises üòä

## Topics

We are looking for talks that help us all learn something about building for the open web and creating a healthier and happier environment to do this work in. Check-out the talks from [2012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0VFbYJlPHw&list=PLLiioAbFTbKMtmUbLWDzpUzayRLC5s2NZ), [2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mb1BaxfIAoU&list=PLLiioAbFTbKP9CxF9Fu4_NQteU_v9wkA3), [2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynmLwV4z8fA&list=PLLiioAbFTbKMoXtKtyj_3eCfzD-eT05gl), [2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWDZP8twWDg&list=PLLiioAbFTbKNpjG_yNpNfhAmQ9KsxFzX7), [2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTWLViHkwf4&list=PLLiioAbFTbKNKyP1m4dmW_xu9byJOPMHe) and [2018](https://2018.cascadiajs.com/speakers/shannon-foster) to get a feel for what kind of talks we gravitate towards. 

There are a few things we are **NOT** looking for:

* Product pitches (How to use product X)
* Intro talks (Getting started with framework Y)
* Negative talks (All the things I hate about Z)
* Comparing frameworks (Why I think E is better than F)

What we *are* looking for:

A great talk tells a story -- it can address issues that developers struggle with, break down and explain complicated topics, and cover new ground in web technology. Below are a few topics that we think are interesting, but it‚Äôs more about you and the story you want to tell.

* Hardware (IoT, robots)
* Art (visuals, music, interactive)
* EcmaScript (ES2019, the future)
* Intelligent Apps (AI, ML)
* APIs (GraphQL, REST, HTTP protocol fun)
* Building more inclusive technical communities and a healthier industry
* Going beyond touch & text (e.g. AR/VR, voice interfaces)
* Web platform (Web Assembly, latest additions)
* Accessibility
* Performance
* Devops (Serverless, Containers, etc)
* Developer Ethics
* Security, Privacy and Trust
* Decentralized Web (IPFS, dat, etc)


## How to Submit a Proposal

First, make sure you're available to attend the conference. It will be held on **November 7-8, 2019**.

Talk submissions are done as 2 minute videos. Your goal here is not to produce a perfectly executed mini-talk, it is to describe your talk idea informally. What's the topic? How do you want to approach it? Why is it interesting? 

We won't make the videos public, so no need to worry about random Internet people seeing them. But we feel this is a good opportunity to start building a comfort level with talking about your idea in front of an audience.

Here is an [example submission](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcYSf2EWFKk&feature=youtu.be) from one of our 2018 speakers, Elgin-Skye McLaren. Here's another one from [Will Klein](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12onj0eQPspOj1bSkL8waM-m52vZgL2IY/view). These videos are meant to be templates, they're just meant to illustrate a few goals: be clear about your topic, share some context for why you care, and please be yourself!

## Stuck on the Idea of a Video Submission?

If you're still hesitant about the video, here's a suggestion. Forget recording for now. Stand up, in a place where no one can hear you, and describe your talk idea out loud. When you're done, start over and do it again, ten times in a row. With a two-minute limit, ten tries only take about 20 minutes. After your tenth try, you may feel much more confident. 

Once you‚Äôve recorded your 2-minute video, just upload it to a public but obfuscated place. Some suggestions: Youtube (mark as unlisted), Dropbox, S3, your own web host. 

## We‚Äôre Here to Help!

There are a million reasons why you might not think you‚Äôre qualified or capable of giving a talk, let alone at CascadiaJS. We are here to prove you wrong. If all you have is a gut feeling that you have something important to share with people, we are here to help you hone your idea and craft a great submission. We are happy to connect you with experienced speakers to help prepare your submission. Just [join our Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/cascadiajs/shared_invite/enQtMzcyMjkzMDk0NjQwLTc3YmJiMTk0NTZjNDBjMzg2YTMxNDA4Njk3YTgyZWY0MGM4NjVhZTI0YTUzYTRmYzRlNThhNTIxOGNkMDU1ZGU) and head over to the #cfp channel. 

If you need more encouragement, check out the following resources:

* Raquel Velez, [Is Your Conference Proposal Good Enough?](http://rckbt.me/2014/01/conference-proposals/)
* Zach Holman, [speaking.io](http://speaking.io/plan/writing-a-cfp/)

Once your talk has been accepted, we will commit to working with you to give an awesome talk. This includes reviewing and advising on slides and helping you practice giving your talk. We can hook you up with local groups or set up a stage for you and a bunch of friends in advance, so you can practice in front of a friendly crowd. Again, whatever else you might need, we‚Äôre here to help.

## The Selection Process

Submissions close on June 30th at 11:59PM PDT. We will get back to all speakers as soon as possible.
