## Directions to the Conference

We strongly encourage folks to take public transportation to the conference and to arrive as early as possible. Town Hall Seattle is located in downtown Seattle and the traffic is pretty awful during the work week. 

Here is a link to [transit and parking information](https://townhallseattle.org/plan-your-visit/location-directions-parking/) for the venue.
