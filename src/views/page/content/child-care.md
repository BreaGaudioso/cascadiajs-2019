Dear Parents,

Big time kidcare provides a safe and fun atmosphere for your children during your event.  Our providers are experienced, CPR trained with national background checks and references, and ready to lead fun activities and crafts during the conference. We will be close by another conference room with plenty of toys and activities. 	

During your conference, we will provide age appropriate activities, games, toys and arts & crafts for children ages newborn to teens.  We will have portable cribs for tired infants and toddlers and any other necessary equipment.

Only persons dropping off the children can pick them up unless prior arrangements have been made. 

ID must be shown at the door to enter.

We would prefer that kids leave their electronics in their hotel room, as there are plenty of fun games and activities to play.  Big time kidcare is not responsible for any lost or damaged electronics.

If your child has special needs which may require extra care or attention, feel free to give us a call or email in advance so we can best prepare for their wellbeing.   Even if your child has mild autism, ADHD etc,  we need to know, to allow us to best take care of your child. We are trained in many levels of special needs. 

Please note, due to the high number of nut allergies, our child care room is a nut free environment. Please refrain from bringing any snacks containing nuts into the child care room.  Thank you for your understanding in this very important matter.   

Parents, who have babies or children in diapers, bring a diaper bag with diapers (cloth is ok), wipes, and bottles/formula/food/ change of clothes if applicable.  We provide swings, playpens, bouncy chairs, and age appropriate toys for your infant.  Parents nursing their babies are more than welcome to nurse in the childcare room, or you can take your child out to nurse, and bring them back after.  Please label all items in your diaper bag.  We are looking forward to taking wonderful care of, and having big time fun with your kids!  

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us. Call or email anytime.
