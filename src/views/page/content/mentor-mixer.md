# Mentor Mixer

In order to make sure that our scholarship recipients and other members of our community who are new to tech get the most out of their CascadiaJS experience, we are organizing a pre-conference Mentor Mixer. Conference attendees who are new to tech or feel like they would benefit by being connected to mentors should feel free to attend. This event will take place in the evening and will feature a mix of some short talks and plenty of time to network and meet people.

Stay tuned for more information about this event and instructions on how to RSVP.

We could not put on this event without the financial and volunteer support of DocuSign!
