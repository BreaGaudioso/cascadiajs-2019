Hi Boss,

I know you're busy, so I'll keep this brief! I know you've invested time in me to teach me about our tech stack and applications and that's awesome. I would like to take two days this year in November to invest in myself and make this partnership even stronger. ðŸ’ª This won't be me spending any time on the beach, but instead packing my brain full of knowledge on JavaScript. I'd love if our company can sponsor me to attend this year. Let me tell you a bit about it:

CascadiaJS is the premier JavaScript conference in the Pacific Northwest and is coming up on its 8th year. This year it's being held in Seattle, WA on Nov 7-8. In addition to the 2-day conference, there are several workshops being run during the week leading up to it, including ReactJS and GraphQL workshops. The conference is packed with talks from 9am-5pm and will be covering everything from web components to GraphQL to the future of serverless and edge software deployments. They also have built in breaks and fun activities surrounding the event so that we have a chance to meet other people from the community!

I know that by attending this event I'll come back to work on Monday full of ideas, new connections in the community and ready to try something new! The best part is, I can share this with colleagues afterwards with the recorded videos too.

So, I'd like to attend and if this sounds like something you think our whole team could be into, they do group discounts for 5 or more people! Thanks for listening and I hope to have an opportunity to attend CascadiaJS this year!

Sincerely,

Your JavaScript enthusiast
