[Spaces](https://www.spacesworks.com/seattle/pioneer-square/) is a beautiful new co-working space located in Pioneer Square and is hosting this year's pre-conference programming workshops. They have been really awesome to work with and have continually asked how they can be of help for the CascadiaJS community. 

We are super exicted to announce that Spaces is offering <span class="exclaim">FREE CO-WORKING</span> for CascadiaJS 2019 attendees through the end of the year! 

All you need to do is [fill-out this form](https://forms.gle/CXbt389Ci6ypkKEm6), show up at the front desk, tell them that you are a CascadiaJS attendee and then you will be ready to go.
