# Weekend Fun Times

There are no official conference events planned for the weekend, but we will organize an unofficial "Farewell Brunch" where you'll have a chance to say good-bye to your new friends over some scrambled eggs and coffee.

If you'd like to organize something fun for fellow Cascadians to participate in (bike ride, fun run, hiking, etc) feel free to fork [this repo](https://github.com/cascadiajs/cascadiajs-2019/), edit this page (`/src/views/page/content/weekend.md`) and submit a PR.

Please include the following bits of information in your PR:

- Name of event / activity
- When/where
- How people can sign-up, opt-in, etc
