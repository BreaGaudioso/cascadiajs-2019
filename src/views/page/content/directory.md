# Conference Directory FAQ

For the first time, we are rolling-out a Conference Directory for CascadiaJS! The purpose of the Directory is to help attendees connect with one another. The directory will display who's coming to CascadiaJS 2019 and support filtering based on things like "lives in Vancouver, BC" or "builds apps using VueJS".

## How do I get listed in the Directory?

When you purchase a ticket to CascadiaJS 2019, you'll have the option of creating a [Fizbuz](https://fizbuz.com) account. Fizbuz is a professional network designed for developers, and we're partnering with Fizbuz to help attendees connect with one another. 

All Fizbuz profiles are default private. Once you're happy with your profile, go and ahead and publish it. Publishing your profile is all you need to do to get listed in the Conference Directory. 

## Q: How do I get un-listed?

If you'd rather not be listed in the Conference Directory, you have two options:

1) Mark your attendance at CascadiaJS 2019 as private

1. [Log-in](https://fizbuz.com/login) to your Fizbuz account
2. Click on "edit" for Experiences
3. Flip "published" to off and "save"
