# Engineer Coffee Chats

Many folks come to CascadiaJS because they are starting to look for a new job. Here are some awesome companies that have **open roles** and are **actively hiring** for them!

* [AWS](/aws)
* [Formidable](/formidable)
* [Stripe](/stripe)
* [WebMocha](/web-mocha)
* [Zulily](/zulily)

During the conference, we will be faciliating casual coffee chats between folks looking for a new role and engineers/managers who have open roles on their team. These are _not_ job interviews, they are meant to be friendly informational chats where both parties can get to know each other and then decide if moving forward to an interview makes sense.

If you don't already have one, make sure you create a <a href="https://fizbuz.com">Fizbuz developer profile</a> prior to requesting a coffee chat. It's the best way to communicate both your skills and your interests to the hiring managers who will be at CascadiaJS.
