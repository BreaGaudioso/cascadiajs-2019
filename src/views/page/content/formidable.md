# Formidable

Formidable is a team of JavaScript experts working together to solve the toughest software problems. We work hard to cultivate a culture of supportive learning and knowledge exchange, both within our office and throughout the greater JavaScript community. In addition to the work we do for clients, our team is well-known for our contributions to the open source software community, creating software used by everyone from Airbnb to Zillow. If you want to join a collaborative community that understands the importance of work-life balance, youâ€™ve come to the right place.

The best ideas are born from a workplace that's inclusive and diverse, from race to gender to ability and so on. When people from varied backgrounds, experiences, and thought processes come together, the greatest outcomes are the result. We believe people are at their best when they have what they need, so we made Formidable a place where all can feel welcomed, supported, and heard. Please, come as you are and be yourself.
