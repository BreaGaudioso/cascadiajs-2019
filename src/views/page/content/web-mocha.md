# Web Mocha

At WebMocha we believe great things happen with the right people. We look for more than technical expertise on our team, we look for the ability to connect dots, we look for a thirst for challenges, we look for grit and more importantly - we look for heart.

Diversity and inclusion aren't just bulletpoints on a Powerpoint deck about culture. We believe that the perspectives gained from our differences give us unique advantages when approaching any problem. Our diversity combined with our years of excperience in technology allow us to approach every challenge with a mature perspective that doesn't compromise innovation. It also helps that we really love working with each other.
